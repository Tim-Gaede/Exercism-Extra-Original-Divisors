# Divisors

Compute the divisors given an array of arrays representing
the prime factors respective powers.


## Example


## Exception messages

Sometimes it is necessary to raise an exception. When you do this, you should include a meaningful error message to
indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. Not
every exercise will require you to raise an exception, but for those that do, the tests will only pass if you include
a message.

To throw an exception, just write it as an argument to the exception type. For example,  

```julia
throw(DomainError("Message indicating the source of the error"))
```

## Submitting Incomplete Solutions
